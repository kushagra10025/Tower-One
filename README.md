# Tower One

## Introduction

The game is based on Tower Defense genre but does not follow all the conventional rules of the genre. A twist has been added to the game that instead of providing the player with many towers it is limited to just one in number. With this limitation, the player has to strategize and fulfill the Ultimate Objective of the game. For this project, it was decided that the theme – ‘**_Vampire_**’ will suit the best, with the story being that a Vampire is trying to save his fellow vampires from the sudden rise of humans in which they use articles which work best against a vampire.

With this limitation in place, the player has been given the freedom to explore the map while picking up the collectibles which will help them in reaching their ultimate goal which again is different from traditional Tower Defense games where the player is static and can only place towers in any given location within a grid.

The Collectibles collected while the player explores the map will help them in upgrading the tower which will in turn help them in achieving their Ultimate Objective.

The target audience for this game will be Children above the age of 8 and elders who are trying to get back that nostalgic feeling of playing games in this genre. Similarly, the target platform for the game will be Desktop and Laptop devices and not mobile because our prime focus will be on the early adopters of the genre.
